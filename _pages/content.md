In my free time, I make videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMFgsiB1pfEGzmeZ7jmeHeg) and stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/wdtlive).

I grew up playing video games and watching popular content creators' streams and videos. In middle school I built a gaming computer and started a gaming channel on YouTube, unfortunately without much noteworthy success. Through that experience, however, I developed a videography and editing skillset that I continue to leverage.

Whether it's in reference to a pasttime like playing video games, or major life decisions like pursuing a STEM degree, I often hear the words "we just don't do that" uttered in my social circles. I want to change that narrative. I want to be an example of polylithic Blackness. I want to prove that one can still "fit in" with the culture while pursuing stereotypically "nerdy" passions. This is a lesson that I didn't learn until my late teens, and one that I think the next generation needs to be exposed to if we want our culture to shift.

Currently, my YouTube content focuses on interview prep, cyber security, and introspections on being a college student. As examples, I have done videos on the [internship process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKJBQr3x_k) and the [basics of zero-day exploits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFv4-4aT6ZU). On Twitch, I stream "study-with-me" sessions, live programming sessions focusing on particular topics, and sometimes just playing games with friends.

Whether teaching about code or streaming video games on a Friday night, I simply want to have my own positive and inclusive corner of the internet. My end goal is to create a safe space for people of ***all*** backgrounds to be themselvesâ€”transcending racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender identities.

I love talking about the future of technology education (and video games)!
