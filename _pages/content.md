Utilizing skills in script writing, video recording, and editing, I had the pleasure of contributing to the USC SPEC Lab's [Applied Data Science Training](https://www.uscspec.org/applied-data-science-trainings) materials. You can find the first of my videos on data visualization in R [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VotVjGAkSiA).

In my free time, I make similar videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMFgsiB1pfEGzmeZ7jmeHeg) and stream on Twitch.

I grew up playing video games and watching popular content creators' streams and videos. In middle school I built a gaming computer and started a gaming channel on YouTube, unfortunately without much noteworthy success. Through that experience, however, I developed a videography and editing skillset that I continue to leverage.

To speak colloquially for a moment, there's a lot of wild stuff on the internet—especially content that's marketed toward young Black and brown people. Negativity sells, but I want to be part of the ongoing movement to change that. I want to set an example of polylithic Blackness. Not all of us are rappers or athletes (and there's nothing wrong with being either of those), but I want to show how to bring the best aspects of our culture to whatever venture we decide to pursue. This is a lesson I didn't learn until my late teens, but it's one that I think the next generation needs to be exposed to if we want our culture to shift.

Currently, my YouTube content focuses on interview prep, cyber security, and introspections on being a college student. As examples, I have done videos on the [internship process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKJBQr3x_k) and the [basics of zero-day exploits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFv4-4aT6ZU). On Twitch, I stream "study-with-me" sessions, live programming sessions focusing on particular topics, and sometimes just playing games with friends.

I'm certainly not the first person to try to bring positivity to the internet, so I want to use my skillset to help in any unique way that I can. Whether teaching about code or streaming video games on a Friday night, I simply want to have my own positive and inclusive corner of the internet. My end goal is to hold space for people of ***all*** backgrounds to be themselves—transcending racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender identities.

I love talking about technology/technology education (and video games)! If you (the reader) have ideas or would like to collaborate, please reach out via email to _wdtaylor30 [at] gmail [dot] com_.
