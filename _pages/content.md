In my free time, I make computer science "edutainment" content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMFgsiB1pfEGzmeZ7jmeHeg) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/wdtlive).

I grew up playing video games and watching popular content creators stream and post videos. In middle school I built a gaming computer and attempted to make the same content, unfortunately without much noteworthy success. Through that experience, however, I developed a videography and editing skillset that I continue to leverage.

Obviously there is a time and place for powerpoint-and-chalkboard-style lectures. However, I believe that to reach the next generation of STEM students a more engaging method must be employed.

I believe that there exists an underexposed, uninterested, and otherwise underrepresented population of individuals that *could* study computer science given access to the appropriate resources. I want to bridge the gap between those students and the current education system that doesn't always reach them. 

Currently, my content focuses on interview prep, cyber security, and applications of data science. As examples, I have done videos on the [internship process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbKJBQr3x_k), and the [basics of zero-day expliots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFv4-4aT6ZU). (Without giving too much away) I'm currently working on a data science video about sports, an exploratory of the basics of DMCA/copyright laws, and nontraditional applications of text generation using machine learning.

I love talking about the future of technology education! If you (the reader) have ideas or simply want to chat about anything, please reach out to _@wdtlive_ on Instagram or via email at _wdtaylor30 [at] gmail [dot] com_. (Please send all business inquiries to the latter email address.)
