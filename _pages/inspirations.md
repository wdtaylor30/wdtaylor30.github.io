This page is a brief exposition on some of my favorite papers, books, and content creators. I could dedicate an entire GitHub Pages project to waxing poetic about things I enjoy, so in the name of brevity I'll limit myself to one or two per category.

## Papers

Perhaps the first paper that validated my interest in computational politics, Thomas Palfrey's 1988 ["A Mathematical Proof of Duverger's Law"](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/81155/1/sswp688.pdf) is bar none my favorite paper. 

I read the paper at a time when I was enjoying my political science work, yet questioning whether continuing in computer science was really for me. Truth be told, I've always grappled with the proof-based classes that I've taken as part of my computer science courseload. However, Palfrey's work made me realize just how far I'd come in my understanding of mathematics and computation; had I not taken upper-level calculus, probability, and discrete math I wouldn't have known where to begin with the paper. Palfrey's impact on my career is two-fold: it both validates my interest in computational rigor in political science, and serves as a reminder of how far I have come in the study of computation.

## Books

I will focus on two titles here: [*Algorithms to Live By*](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-to-Live-By-audiobook/dp/B01D24NAL6/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=algorithms+to+live+by&qid=1640828447&sprefix=algorithms+to+%2Caps%2C310&sr=8-1) and [*Data Feminism*](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Feminism/dp/B08HSHRVVW/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=data+feminism&qid=1640828473&s=audible&sprefix=data+fem%2Caudible%2C157&sr=1-1). Both are books I'm slowly but steadily working through, but they've already given me great insight.

*Algorithms to Live By* is a tome of engaging examples of how computation can be used in eveveryday life. I love that it goes beyond the clich√© "a recipe is an algorithm" and dives into examples ranging from determining regular-season football matchups to applications of the optimal stopping problem in dating. I must say it's a terrible bedtime read, as I have spent many long nights mulling over the deep examples the authors give.

*Data Feminism* is a vitally important work exploring the intersectional nature of the work we do as data scientists. The authors build their claims based on seminal works from the likes of Crenshaw and hooks, as well as modern-day examples such as AI-centric controversies at major tech companies. A PI in my summer research lab recommended the book to me, and it has instilled in me the gravity of the work that we do as researchers.

## Content Creators

Two of my favorite educational YouTube channels are [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/c/numberphile)/[Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile)/[Deep Sky Videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/DeepSkyVideos) and [Vi Hart](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vihart) (I know that's technically four separate channels, but the first three are all produced by the same person, hence the slashes).

Numberphile et al. are channels dedicated to scientific communication. What I enjoy most about them is that each video is led by an expert in the field who is equally as proficient in communication. They're not open-courseware lectures but informal conversations, almost like going to a professor's office hours and having them say "here's something cool I found out recently." The mix of expertise with down-to-earth communication is what inspired me to try my hand at edutainment. (It's a career goal of mine to one day be part of a Computerphile or Numberphile video). Whenever I feel out-of-touch with my computer science studies, their videos ground me and put the fun back in it. <br><br>

To me, Vi Hart is equal parts enigma and genius. I was first introduced to their videos in high school by my music theory teacher, who showed their [Twelve Tone Row](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4niz8TfY794) video to the class. Much like the Numberphile videos, I enjoy Vi's pen-and-paper style of video. Perhaps what I admire most about them is that they center their work on what *they* find interesting, not necessarily what they think will get the most views. Both practically and philosophically, I hope to incorporate much of Vi's style in my own content.

As a final thought, I find inspiration from many sources, from music to video games to science-fiction and fantasy novels. Please feel free to email/DM me with recommendations of works that you (the reader) find inspring!
