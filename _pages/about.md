*I had the honor of being a member of the 2022 [American Political Science Association Ralphe Bunch Summer Institute](https://www.apsanet.org/DIVERSITY/Ralph-Bunche-Summer-Institute/About-the-RBSI-Program) cohort.*

I am a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I'm working toward a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. My primary areas of focus are criminal justice, cyber security and data science. <br> <br>

I currently work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant with [Dr. Frank Baumgartner](https://fbaum.unc.edu/). My tasks primarily consist of collecting, cleaning, and reshaping state-level data to be merged with his country-level criminal justice databases. <br> <br>

After graduation I hope to continue to analyze politics through a quantitative lens. My main interests lie in the application of novel methodologies to American criminal justice studies. Methodologies that interest me include machine learning, text analysis, rare event analysis, game theory, and the creation and usage of large-$n$ datasets. Susbtantively I am interested in disparate criminal justice outcomes, as well as privacy, free speech and cyber security concerns.<br><br>

I'm also interested in the ethics behind quantitative studies. As I continute to do quantitative research, I'm obligated to become a responsible user and consumer of data. To that end, I'm interested in tackling issues of algorithmic bias, in academia as well as in industry.
