Hello! I am a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I'm working toward a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, and a Minor in Data Science. <br> <br>

After graduation I plan on pursuing a Ph.D., either in Political Science or Computer Science.<br> <br>

My interests in the utilization of quantitative and computational methodologies to study political phenomena. Examples of past work include generating visualizations based on country-year datasets, as well as visualizing and creating regression models from survey data. <br> <br>

I'm also interested in technology efficacy. As I continute to do quantitative research, I'm obligated to become a responsible user and consumer of data. To that end, I'm interested in tackling issues of algorithmic bias, in academia as well as in industry.
