Hello! I am a first-year doctoral student in political science and public policy at the University of Michigan. My works attemps to find novel use cases for the application of computational methods to questions related to vulnerability and punishment. More specifically, I am interested in policies that expose populations with limited social, political, and/or economic capital to various forms of legal and extralegal punishment, whether intentionally or otherwise. I am also interested in how individuals think about and respond to these policies based on salient identies like race, ethnicity, gender, and religion. Finally, I am interested in questions regarding the governance of emerging technologies, with privacy, security, and fairness in mind.

Since January 2023 I have worked as an analyst at the UNC School of Government [Criminal Justice Innovation Lab](https://cjil.sog.unc.edu/). I perform data engineering tasks on large-$n$ aministrative data and county-level jail population data. I pull theory from the worlds of data architecture, data science, and software engineering to help the Lab scale its data operations. I also perform routine observational and intervention-based analyses with applied time series methods, and draft prose for Lab reports.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with a second major in Political Science, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
