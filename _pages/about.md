*I had the honor of being a member of the [2022 American Political Science Association Ralph Bunche
 Summer Institute](https://www.apsanet.org/DIVERSITY/Ralph-Bunche-Summer-Institute/About-the-RBSI-Program) cohort.*

Hello! I am a recent graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. My primary areas of interest are criminal justice, socioeconomic inequality and formal, quantitative, and computational methods. I am currently applying to doctoral programs in public policy and political science during the 2023-2024 application cycle.

Since January 2023 I have worked as an analyst at the UNC School of Government [Criminal Justice Innovation Lab](https://cjil.sog.unc.edu/). I perform data engineering tasks on large-$n$, county-level jail population data. I pull theory from the worlds of data architecture, data science, and cyber security to help the Lab scale its data operations. I also perform routine statistical analyses and hypothesis tests, and draft prose for Lab reports.

Prior to this position, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant with [Dr. Frank Baumgartner](https://fbaum.unc.edu/) and [Dr. Marty Davidson (Dept. of Political Science, UW-Madison via Michigan)](https://polisci.wisc.edu/staff/davidson-marty/), learning about spatial approaches to documenting disparate criminal justice contact in North Carolina.

I am also interested in the ethics behind quantitative studies. As I continute to do quantitative research, I'm obligated to become a responsible user and consumer of data. To that end, I'm interested in tackling issues of algorithmic bias, in academia as well as in industry.
