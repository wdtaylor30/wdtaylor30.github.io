*Myself with my 2022 Ralphe Bunch Summer Institute cohort.*

I am a rising senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I'm working toward a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. My primary areas of focus are cyber security and data science. <br> <br>

I currently work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant with [Dr. Frank Baumgartner](https://fbaum.unc.edu/), who does statistical research on the death penalty. My tasks primarily consist of collecting, cleaning, and reshaping state-level data to be merged with his country-level database. <br> <br>

After graduation I plan on puruing a Ph.D. in political science. My interests lie in the development of novel quantitative and computational methodologies. Methodologies that interest me include the use of novel data sources (e.g., social media scraping), machine learning (e.g., natural language processing), rare event analysis, novel experimental designs, and social science software package development.<br><br> 

My future work will continue to be interdisciplinary in nature, working within teams of scholars from different backgrounds to push the boundaries of computation in social science. I'm also interested in the ethics behind empirical studies. As I continute to do quantitative research, I'm obligated to become a responsible user and consumer of data. To that end, I'm interested in tackling issues of algorithmic bias, in academia as well as in industry.
