Hello! I am a first-year doctoral student in political science and public policy at the University of Michigan. My works applies novel computational methods to questions of vulnerability and punishment. More specifically, I am interested in policies that expose populations with limited social, political, and/or economic capital to various forms of legal and/or extralegal punishment, whether intentionally or otherwise. I am also interested in how individuals think about and respond to these policies based on salient identies like race, ethnicity, gender, and religion. Finally, I am interested in the governance of emerging technologies that might help or harm vulnerable populations, keeping privacy, security, and fairness in mind.

Since January 2023 I have worked as an analyst at the UNC School of Government [Criminal Justice Innovation Lab](https://cjil.sog.unc.edu/). I apply time series, NLP, and other computational methods to projects related to bail reform, alternative responses to behavioral health crises, and [criminal record clearance](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/RecordClearanceDashboard/). I combine computer science theory with policy expertise to scale the Lab's analytic capabilities on these and other projects.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with a second major in Political Science, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
