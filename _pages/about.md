*I had the honor of being a member of the [2022 American Political Science Association Ralph Bunche
 Summer Institute](https://www.apsanet.org/DIVERSITY/Ralph-Bunche-Summer-Institute/About-the-RBSI-Program) cohort.*

Hello! I am a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am working toward a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. My primary areas of focus are criminal justice and formal, quantitative, and computational methods.

I currently work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the UNC School of Government's [Criminal Justice Innovation Lab](https://cjil.sog.unc.edu/).

Prior to this, I worked with [Dr. Frank Baumgartner](https://fbaum.unc.edu/) and some of his graduate students. I am currently working with [Marty Davidson (Dept. of Political Science, Michigan)](https://www.martydavidson.com/), learning about spatial approaches to documenting disparate criminal justice contact in North Carolina.

I'm also interested in the ethics behind quantitative studies. As I continute to do quantitative research, I'm obligated to become a responsible user and consumer of data. To that end, I'm interested in tackling issues of algorithmic bias, in academia as well as in industry.
