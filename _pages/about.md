Hello! I am a first-year doctoral student in political science and public policy at the University of Michigan. My works applies novel computational methods to the study of social vuulnerability. More specifically, I am interested in how populations with limited social, political, and/or economic capital respond to shocks, as well as policies that aid or debilitate their ability to do so. I am also interested in how individuals think about and respond to these policies based on salient identies like race, ethnicity, gender, and religion. Finally, I am interested in the governance of emerging technologies that might help or harm vulnerable populations, keeping privacy, security, and fairness in mind.

Since January 2023 I have worked as an analyst with the UNC School of Government [Criminal Justice Innovation Lab](https://cjil.sog.unc.edu/). I apply time series, NLP, and other computational methods to projects related to bail reform, alternative responses to behavioral health crises, and [criminal record clearance](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/RecordClearanceDashboard/), and [the North Carolina criminal legal landscape at large](https://cjil.shinyapps.io/MeasuringJustice/). I combine computer science theory with policy expertise to scale the Lab's analytic capabilities on these and other projects.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in computer science, with a second major in political science, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
