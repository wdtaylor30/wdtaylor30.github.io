*I had the honor of being a member of the [2022 American Political Science Association Ralph Bunche
 Summer Institute](https://www.apsanet.org/DIVERSITY/Ralph-Bunche-Summer-Institute/About-the-RBSI-Program) cohort.*

Hello! I am a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am working toward a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. My primary areas of focus are criminal justice and formal/quantitative methods. <br> <br>

I currently work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant with [Dr. Frank Baumgartner](https://fbaum.unc.edu/) and some of his graduate students. I am currently working with [Marty Davidson (Dept. of Political Science, Michigan)](https://www.martydavidson.com/), learning about spatial approaches to documenting disparate criminal justice contact in North Carolina. <br> <br>

After graduation I hope to continue to analyze politics through a computational lens. My main interests lie in the application of novel methodologies to American criminal justice studies. Methodologies that interest me include modeling for causal inference, text analysis, and the creation and management of large-$n$ datasets. Susbtantively I am interested in urban political economy, espcailly social vulnerability factors that lead to disparate criminal justice outcomes.<br><br>

I'm also interested in the ethics behind quantitative studies. As I continute to do quantitative research, I'm obligated to become a responsible user and consumer of data. To that end, I'm interested in tackling issues of algorithmic bias, in academia as well as in industry.
