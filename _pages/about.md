*I had the honor of being a member of the 2022 [Ralphe Bunch Summer Institute](https://www.apsanet.org/DIVERSITY/Ralph-Bunche-Summer-Institute/About-the-RBSI-Program) cohort.*

I am a rising senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I'm working toward a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. My primary areas of focus are cyber security and data science. <br> <br>

I currently work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant with [Dr. Frank Baumgartner](https://fbaum.unc.edu/). My tasks primarily consist of collecting, cleaning, and reshaping state-level data to be merged with his country-level criminal justice databases. <br> <br>

After graduation I plan on puruing a Ph.D. in political science. My interests lie in the application of novel methodologies to cyber security studies. Methodologies that interest me include novel experimental designs, text analysis, rare event analysis, game theory, and the creation and usage of large-$n$ datasets. I am also intersted in finding ways to map traditional cyber security paradigms such as threat modeling to state-level entities. Substantiatively, I am interested in the causes, correlates, and outcomes of cyber attacks, censorship, and misinformation.<br><br>

In my work I hope to combine traditional cyber security standards and methodologies with empirical research to examine political and economic causes and effects. I look foward to working working interdisciplinary teams of scholars to make strides in security studies. I'm also interested in the ethics behind quantitative studies. As I continute to do quantitative research, I'm obligated to become a responsible user and consumer of data. To that end, I'm interested in tackling issues of algorithmic bias, in academia as well as in industry.
