# About Me
![image](images/headshot.JPEG)
    I am a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. <br>
    I'm working toward a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, a Bachelor
    of Arts in Political Science, and a Minor in Data Science. <br> <br>

    My interests lie at the intersection of technology and policy.
    I'm intersted in security issues such as national/election security and
    cybercrime. I look for ways to combine my studies of domestic politics
    and international relations with my understanding of the technical
    aspects of information security. <br> <br>

    I'm also interested in technology efficacy.
    As I continue my studies in data science, I'm obligated to become a
    responsible user and consumer of data. I'm interested in tackling
    issues of algorithmic bias, in academia as well as in industry.
