I am a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. <br>
I'm working toward a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, a Bachelor
of Arts in Political Science, and a Minor in Data Science. <br>
After graduation, I plan on pursuing a Ph.D., either in Political Science or Computer Science.<br> <br>

My interests lie in the the utilization of quantitative and computational methodologies to study political phenomena.
Examples of past work include generating visualizations based on country-year datasets, as well as visualizing and creating regression models from survey data. <br> <br>

Looking ahead to my senior thesis/graduate school, I'm interested in exploring if...
- network analysis can be used to model international cyber attacks.
- clustering methods and spatial voting theory can be used to study affective polarization.
- set theory can be used to further current literature on Duverger's Law.<br> <br>

I'm also interested in technology efficacy.
As I continue to do quantitative research, I'm obligated to become a
responsible user and consumer of data. I'm interested in tackling
issues of algorithmic bias, in academia as well as in industry.
