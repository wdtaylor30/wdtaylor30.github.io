I am a junior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
I'm working toward a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, a Bachelor
of Arts in Political Science, and a Minor in Data Science. <br> <br>
After graduation, I plan on pursuing a Ph.D., either in Political Science or Computer Science.<br> <br>

My interests lie in the the utilization of quantitative and computational methodologies to study political phenomena. Examples of past work include generating visualizations based on country-year datasets, as well as visualizing and creating regression models from survey data. <br> <br>

I'm especially interested in the impact of technology on the modern policial sphere. Looking ahead to my senior thesis/graduate school, I'm interested in learning about and using:
- generative adversarial networks to explore the use cases and implications of deepfakes in politics.
- hypergraphs to model the interconnectedness of social media bots with malicious political intent.
- supervised learning to detect those aformentioned social media bots. <br><br>

I'm also interested in technology efficacy.
As I continue to do quantitative research, I'm obligated to become a
responsible user and consumer of data. I'm interested in tackling
issues of algorithmic bias, in academia as well as in industry.
